						<p class="top-margin-20">“This album had to be about the songs,” says Melissa Etheridge of her tenth studio album, Fearless Love.</p>
              <p>This is typical of Melissa, because putting the songs first is one of the hallmarks of her career. From our introduction to her in 1988, and throughout her illustrious career, Etheridge has never forgotten that it all begins with the songs. She has poured everything into those songs and they have served her well.</p>
             <p>Those songs—“Bring Me Some Water,” “Ain’t it Heavy,” “I’m the Only One,” “Come to My Window,” “I Want to Come Over,” “Angels Would Fall,” “I Run for Life” and “I Need to Wake Up” among them—have rewarded her with five Platinum albums (including the multi-Platinum sets Melissa Etheridge, Your Little Secret  and the six-million-selling Yes I Am), a pair of Grammys®, an Oscar®, an ASCAP Songwriter of the Year honor and the ASCAP Founders Award.</p>
              <p>Easily one of the greatest all-time female rock icons, Melissa Etheridge is also a mother and a cancer survivor. She is an outspoken cultural, political and human rights activist, a thought-provoker and a longtime truth-seeker.</p>
              <p>With Fearless Love, which comes out April 27th, 2010, on Island Records, she is at the top of her game.</p>
